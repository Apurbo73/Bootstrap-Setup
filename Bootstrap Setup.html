                Rama (/ˈrɑːmə/;[4] Sanskrit: राम, IAST: Rāma, Sanskrit: [ˈraːmɐ]
                ⓘ) is a major deity in Hinduism. He is worshipped as the seventh
                and one of the most popular avatars of Vishnu.[5] In
                Rama-centric Hindu traditions, he is considered the Supreme
                Being. Also considered as the ideal man (maryāda puruṣottama),
                Rama is the male protagonist of the Hindu epic Ramayana. His
                birth is celebrated every year on Rama Navami, which falls on
                the ninth day of the bright half (Shukla Paksha) of the lunar
                cycle of Chaitra (March–April), the first month in the Hindu
                calendar.[6][7]

                  Sita (Sanskrit: सीता; IAST: Sītā), also known as Siya, Jānaki
                  and Maithili, is a Hindu goddess and the female protagonist of
                  the Hindu epic Ramayana. Sita is the consort of Rama, the
                  avatar of god Vishnu, and is regarded as an avatar of goddess
                  Lakshmi.[12] She is the chief goddess of the Ramanandi
                  Sampradaya and is the goddess of beauty and devotion. Sita's
                  birthday is celebrated every year on the occasion of Sita
                  Navami.[13] Described as the daughter of Bhūmi (the earth),
                  Sita is brought up as the adopted daughter of King Janaka of
                  Videha.[14][15] Sita, in her youth, chooses Rama, the prince
                  of Ayodhya as her husband in a swayamvara. After the
                  swayamvara, she accompanies her husband to his kingdom but
                  later chooses to accompany him along with her brother-in-law
                  Lakshmana, in his exile. While in exile, the trio settles in
                  the Dandaka forest from where she is abducted by Ravana, the
                  Rakshasa king of Lanka. She is imprisoned in the garden of
                  Ashoka Vatika, in Lanka, until she is rescued by Rama, who
                  slays her captor. After the war, in some versions of the epic,
                  Rama asks Sita to undergo Agni Pariksha (an ordeal of fire),
                  by which she proves her chastity, before she is accepted by
                  Rama, which for the first time makes his brother Lakshmana
                  angry at him.

            <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is

            overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS
            transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or
            overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just
            about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>,
            though the transition does limit overflow.

                Lakshmana (Sanskrit: लक्ष्मण, lit. 'the one endowed with
                auspicious signs', IAST: Lakṣmaṇa), also known as Laxmana,
                Lakhan, Saumitra, and Ramanuja, is the younger brother of Rama
                in the Hindu epic Ramayana. He is considered as an incarnation
                of Shesha, the lord of serpents.[2] Lakshmana was married to
                Urmila, and is known for his loyalty and dedication towards
                Rama.[3][4] Lakshmana was born to King Dasharatha of Ayodhya and
                Queen Sumitra. Shatrughna, is his twin brother. He was married
                to Urmila, after his brother Rama married Sita in her
                swayamvara. Lakshmana devoted himself to Rama since childhood
                and accompanied him during his fourteen-year exile, serving him
                and Sita endlessly. He also played a pivotal role in the war and
                killed Meghanada. Lakshmana is worshipped in Hinduism, at
                various places in India, alongside his wife and brother.[5]

              <p>
                Hanuman (/ˈhʌnʊˌmɑːn/; Sanskrit: हनुमान्, IAST: Hanumān),[5]
                also known as Maruti, Bajrangabali, and Anjaneya,[6] is a deity
                in Hinduism, revered as a divine vanara, and a devoted companion
                of the deity Rama. Central to the Ramayana, Hanuman is
                celebrated for his unwavering devotion to Rama and is considered
                a chiranjivi. He is traditionally believed to be the spiritual
                offspring of the wind deity Vayu, who is said to have played a
                significant role in his birth.[7][8] In Shaiva tradition, he is
                regarded to be an incarnation of Shiva, while in most of the
                Vaishnava traditions he is the son and incarnation of Vayu. His
                tales are recounted not only in the Ramayana but also in the
                Mahabharata and various Puranas.
