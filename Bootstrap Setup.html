        <p>
          Rama (/ˈrɑːmə/;[4] Sanskrit: राम, IAST: Rāma, Sanskrit: [ˈraːmɐ] ⓘ) is
          a major deity in Hinduism. He is worshipped as the seventh and one of
          the most popular avatars of Vishnu.[5] In Rama-centric Hindu
          traditions, he is considered the Supreme Being. Also considered as the
          ideal man (maryāda puruṣottama), Rama is the male protagonist of the
          Hindu epic Ramayana. His birth is celebrated every year on Rama
          Navami, which falls on the ninth day of the bright half (Shukla
          Paksha) of the lunar cycle of Chaitra (March–April), the first month
          in the Hindu calendar.[6][7]
